Tools to build charge density models using [[https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp][ocpmodels]]

Much of the code in the DeepDFT directory is copied from [[https://github.com/peterbjorgensen/DeepDFT][DeepDFT]]. However, some small changes are made for compatibility with the ocpmodles infrastructure. Notable changes include:

- Switching neighborlist generation from asap3 to pymatgen
- Adding the probe model to the OCP registry
